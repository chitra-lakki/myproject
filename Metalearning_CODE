# STEP 3: META-LEARNING APPROACH

# 1. DEFINE META-LEARNING TASKS

# SPLIT THE DATA INTO MULTIPLE RELATED TASKS
task_count = 3
tasks = []
tasks_labels = []

# DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES FOR EACH TASK
samples_per_task = segments_normalized.shape[0] // task_count

for _ in range(task_count):
    # RANDOMLY SAMPLE A SUBSET OF SEGMENTS AND THEIR LABELS FOR EACH TASK
    task_indices = random.sample(range(segments_normalized.shape[0]), samples_per_task)
    task_segments = segments_normalized[task_indices]
    task_segment_labels = segment_labels[task_indices]
    
    # Ensuring that each segment has a corresponding label
    if len(task_segment_labels) != len(task_segments):
        raise ValueError("Mismatch between number of segments and labels.")

    tasks.append(task_segments)
    tasks_labels.append(task_segment_labels)

# 2. MODEL SELECTION

# CHOOSE APPROPRIATE BASE MODELS
base_models = {
    'Neural Network': MLPClassifier(max_iter=500, random_state=42),
    'Support Vector Machine': SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
}

# 3. META-LEARNING FRAMEWORK

# IMPLEMENT A SIMPLE META-LEARNING FRAMEWORK (E.G., TRAIN EACH BASE MODEL ON EACH TASK)
meta_results = {}

for model_name, model in base_models.items():
    task_accuracies = []
    for i, (task_segments, task_labels) in enumerate(zip(tasks, tasks_labels)):
        # RESHAPE SEGMENTS AND ENSURE LABELS MATCH THE SEGMENT SHAPE
        num_samples = task_segments.shape[0]  # Number of samples in the task
        task_segments_reshaped = task_segments.reshape(num_samples, -1)
        task_labels = task_labels.flatten()  # Ensure task_labels is a 1D array

        # SPLIT EACH TASK INTO TRAIN AND TEST SETS
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(task_segments_reshaped,
                                                            task_labels,
                                                            test_size=0.3,
                                                            random_state=42)
